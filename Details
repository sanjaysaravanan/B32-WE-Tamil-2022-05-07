Recap: Last Week
  Node --> Javascript runtime env without browser
  modularize --> export from the a file, import in another file
  npm --> node packager manager  ---> install external third party libraries into our codebase
  npx --> node package executable ---> to run a executable script and set the initial template codebase or setup ( create-react-app )

  SPA --> Single Page Application ( Single HTML )
    Single is rendered and the DOM inside is manipulated with interactions and ajax( asynchronous operations ) calls
  
  React Setup:
    npx create-react-app sample-app --> this create react project under folder sample-app

    cd sample-app

    npm start


Topics:

  Components (simple HTML layout to reusable react components)
    Functional ---> Direct return of JSX 
    Class Components ---> extend from React.Compoent & return JSX inside render
  
    Props
      Passing data through props
      Functional  ---> First arguement takes all props as a single object. Arguement level destructuring is possible
      Class ---> this.props take all props as a single object

    State
      data change inside the JSX syntax
      Functional ---> useState hook to handle data change inside DOM
      class ---> Initialize State values in Constructor and Change the State value with this.setState

  working with array lists ---> Use Map to render or return JSX 
  usage of keys ---> used to identify the DOM Node/Element in the DOM Tree


  conditional rendering ---> conditional render some content into the DOM
  ? render used to used render this or that
  && used to render content only on true condition
